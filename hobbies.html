            <h3>Comics</h3>
            <p>Comics have influenced the largest part of my life, as they were how I connected with my lifelong friends and the things we've all experienced together. My favorite brand will always be DC (The new 'Superman' movie was awesome!)
            but I also enjoy Marvel, Star Wars, Transformers, and many independent comics as well.

            <h3>Outdoors</h3>
            <p>I enjoy doing outdoor activities such as Fishing and travelling bike trails, but I have a low tolerance for cold weather so spring and summer are the seasons I enjoy most.</p>

            <h3>TV and Games</h3>
            <p>When I've locked myself inside to avoid cold weather, usually I find myself watching movies and Tv series' or playing games with friends and family 
            (Recently I finished watching an old TNT show called 'Leverage' and I've been playing a lot of Monster Hunter Wilds/Dispatch on my PS5, as well as the 'Villainous' card game series with my brother). 
            Beyond that, I also enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, primarily because I enjoy roleplaying.</p>
