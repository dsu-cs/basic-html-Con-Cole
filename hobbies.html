            <li>Comic Reading</li>
            <p>Comics have been the largest influence of my life, as they were how I connected with my lifelong friends and the things we've all experienced together. My favorite brand will always be DC (The new 'Superman' movie was awesome!)
            but I also enjoy Marvel, Star Wars, Transformers, and many independent comics as well.</p>
            <li>Outdoors</li>
            <p>I enjoy doing outdoor activities such as Fishing and travelling bike trails, but I have a low tolerance for cold weather so spring and summer are the seasons I enjoy most.</p>
            <li>TV and Games</li>
            <p>When I've locked myself inside to avoid cold weather, usually I find myself watching movies and Tv series' or playing games with friends and family. Here are some of the games I've recently played throughout the fall semester:</p>
