        <ol>
            <li>Technology</li>
            <p>I grew up watching my dad fix computers for a living and it sparked a life long curiosity about technology and how it works. I like to study game development in my free time and learn about the complex mechanics of my favoite games</p>
            <li>Music</li>
            <p>My entire family is comprised of theatre kids. Music is a large part of my life, and I spent all 4 years of high school practicing songs in symphonic band and honors choir.</p>
            <li>Travel</li>
            <p>The world is a vast place and I love exploring new places and experiencing how different cultures live in it. I feel like traveling to different countries has broadened my horizons and given me many new perspectives.</p>
